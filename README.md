In this project, I analyzed the sales data of a retail store  multiple stores and performed time series forecasting using the ARIMA and SARIMA models . After exploratory analysis, I checked for stationarity in the time series data using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test and observed that the data was  stationary.  Next, I used the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots to identify the parameters for the ARIMA model. I fitted the ARIMA model to the data and evaluated its performance using mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). I obtained an RMSE value of 4.42. Later SARIMA model was fitted on the data after finding the optimal parameters with low Akaike Information Criterion(AIC). I then evaluated its performance and obtained an RMSE value of 2.13, which was significantly better than that of the ARIMA model. Hence, I successfully build a forecasting system to predict the sales of different items at different stores based on historical data using SARIMA model.
